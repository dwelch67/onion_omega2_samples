The led lives on GPIO44

This is a mimimal example in assembly langauge to demonstrate a working
program (see top level README).  This writes 0x1000 to 0x10000634 which
cause the (amber) led to go off.  Not uncommon to see the GPIO be on
the sink side of the led rather than the source (GPIO off or zero makes
the led go on rather than off).
