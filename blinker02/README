There are two timers timer0 and timer1 this uses timer0.  The timer
is driven by a 1MHz clock (1 microsecond per tick).  The timer is
a 16 bit timer with a 16 bit prescaler.  So we can only count to 65536
on the main timer.  1000000/65536 = 15.258.  So if we use a prescaler
of /16  1000000/16 = 62500.  So to count to 2 seconds double the
prescaler to 32.

The led should change state once every 2 seconds.
