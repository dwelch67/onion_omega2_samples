I have lightly touched on MIPS before, learning more as I go here which
was a reason for getting these boards.

There is a coprocesssor 0 count register that is in theory a free-running
counter.  Comparing it against a stopwatch I see 287Mhz which is half
of the 575 we are maybe running at.  So assuming that is true then this
counter ticks off at 287500000 ticks per second so two seconds is
575000000 ticks.  The register counts up.  I will leave it as an
exercise to the reader to understand that so long as you give yourself
a little distance from the max count and you properly mask (in this case
it is a 32 bit register with 32 bit math so it automatically masks itself
but I put a mask there to emphasize the point, a 24 bit counter with
32 bit math for example wouldnt work unless you mask the result, again
an exercise to the reader).

So the led changes state every 2 seconds.
